# Adulting for the Millenial Zombie - an API Project 

## Project Description 

This project was completed as part of the full-time immersive Software Engineering course with General Assembly. The requirement is to build a frontend application using React and available APIs. 

### **Background of Project**
"Office Critter" was conceived off my personal interests towards improving daily productivity, as well as my personal desire for a self-built app that could help me track the things that mattered to me. Office Critter can be used by anyone on a desktop/laptop, whether they're at the office or working from home.

Objectives to be met with this topic:
- [ ] Build a web application using React framework;
- [ ] Use 3rd party API(s);
- [ ] Create wireframes for the app
- [ ] Use the CRUD method (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

### **Tools Used and Crediting Sources** 

- Vite 
- ReactJS 
- JavaScript 
- API documentation
  - UnSplash Photos
  - OpenWeatherMap
  - Numbers API (which unfortunately could not be deployed in Vercel, so it had to be scrapped)
  - New York Times API
- Libraries 
  - Tailwind CSS
  - DaisyUI
  - ChartJS 
### **The Planning Process**

To kick off my planning for this project, I began by brainstorming ideas of digital products that I wished I had when I was working. I had originally envisioned working on a project focused on visual experiences, where I intended to use the API by NASA to create a project displaying the marvels of humanity's scientific milestones. However for the purposes of this project, I decided to keep NASA as a pet project, so that I could work on building a work resource that would focus on either: 
- enhancing business operations, or
- personal productivity. 

With these 2 ideas in tow, I decided to build an app in a way that was important to me, while merging together ideas from brief feedback sessions with my close friends and loved ones on what tools (on top of existing ) could help them manage day-to-day tasks. The Office Critter idea was then born. 

### Wireframing 

For illustration purposes, I will be sharing the wireframes for two of the main features of my webpage - the main entry page and the task management page. 

![Main Entry Page](/Media/WireframeHomePage.JPG "Main Entry Page")

I wanted to create a starting page that would give the user the overall feeling of beginning a new day, and that they were being greeted by a task helper. This wireframe is a very rudimentary mock up of the actual interface, which will be visited in the next section. 

![Task Management Page](/Media/WireframeTaskPage.JPG "Task Management Page")

Another example of one of my wireframes is the Task Management Page, which is the principal feature of my webpage. The idea was to have an text field that would take in instructions from the user, who would then submit their task for the day and have it added to the field below. Tasks marked as done would be removed from the list, and in the actual interface, I also used ChartJS to map out the number of tasks input versus the tasks completed, to allow the user to know how large their gap in productivity is. This idea will be elucidated in subsequent sections.

### **App Interface** 

This section will cover the salient functionalities of Office Critter. 

**Start**

In Office Critter, I decided against using local storage to save individual profiles (which sounds great and I'm sure that's what some people prefer to experience) because the app is currently focused on day-to-day tasks and is, at the moment, not meant to 'keep the tasks overnight'. The app focuses on helping users to accomplish achievable targets for the day and, hopefully, spurs the individual to focus solely on the tasks they absolutely need to complete on the day. On this note, I do have future plans to improve and expand this system, and it will be elaborated on in the Future Plans section at the end of this README document.

**Weather and Lifestyle**

### **Challenges Faced**
blah blah

(talk about how numbers API doesn't work due to CORS and the remedy didn't work)

### **Improvements To Be Made**

blah blah
(CSS needs to be better and responsive to the webpage size)

### **Future Plans For Expansion**

blah blah

(elaborate step by step how you want to use local storage to save and track tasks on a date/calendar basis )

## A Summary 

Looking back, this project has been most enjoyable and educational for me. Office Critter was definitely a great outlet for me to eperiment with the following areas:
- User Story
- User Research 
- Exploring libraries and discovering awesome APIs to contribute to the app
- Deciding on functionalities and breaking it down into smaller portions to make the code, make the functionality happen!
- Practicing creating websites using React.

For the next few projects, I hope to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can do and sourcing for solutions to understand coding problems better.
